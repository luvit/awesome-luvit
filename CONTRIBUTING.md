# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add to the list:** Submit a pull request
- **To remove from the list:** Open an issue
- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar
with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To stay on the list, package repositories should adhere to these quality
standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Functional
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when
  they arise)
- Stable, or progressing toward stable
- Documented (preferably godoc.org)
- Tests are preferred (when possible)


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you find anything that could be improved or have
suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes
packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of
time, so if you see that, please let us know. We also realize that sometimes
projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature.
These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental
-- again, just open an issue. Thanks everyone!
